**Unnamed Power Core: Isky Parody** is a parody by [IskandarAlex2](https://github.com/IskandarAlex2) of [Unnamed Power Core](https://www.roblox.com/games/746120281) by [Tecc.src](https://twitter.com/SourceAvailable) on Roblox. This parody falls under [Iskyverse](https://github.com/IskandarAlex2/IskandarAlex2/blob/master/Iskyverse.md) as its own subuniverse.

This parody refine the game and make it more to a maintaining the reactor rather than "wait 20 minutes for something to explode" simulator.

Made with [Unreal Engine 5.4](https://www.unrealengine.com). This game do not prioritize graphic photorealism and more to scientific accuracy mix with some additional science fiction aspects. After all, the game revolves around a floating plasma ball reactor.

Other than being a game, this project also meant to help beginners to start with their Unreal Engine game development as a learning material.
